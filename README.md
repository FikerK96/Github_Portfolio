# Github_Portfolio

This repository contains a simple, friendly professional portfolio static site.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main single-page portfolio with About, Skills, Resume, Academic Work, and Internships sections.
- `css/styles.css` — minimal styles for a clean, professional look.
- `resume.pdf` — placeholder file. Replace with your real resume PDF (same filename) to enable the download button.

To view locally:

```bash
# from the repository root
xdg-open index.html
```

Or open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use your editor's live preview).
