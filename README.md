# Github_Portfolio

This repository contains a simple, friendly professional portfolio static site.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main single-page portfolio with About, Skills, Resume, Academic Work, and Internships sections.
- `css/styles.css` — minimal styles for a clean, professional look.
- `resume.pdf` — placeholder file. Replace with your real resume PDF (same filename) to enable the download button.

To view locally:

```bash
# from the repository root
xdg-open index.html
```

Or open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use your editor's live preview).

To replace the resume:

1. Export your resume as a PDF named `resume.pdf`.
2. Replace the placeholder `resume.pdf` in the repo root.
3. Commit and push.

Next steps you may want me to do:

- Add your real content (copy/paste your About text, skills, and academic project details).
- Create a separate page for a downloadable/printable resume or embed a nicer viewer.
- Add a contact form and deploy the site (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).
